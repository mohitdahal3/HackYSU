# Life Cycle of a Star

## Birth

- Starting in interstellar medium made of gas and dust.
	- Typically 70% hydrogen, 28% helium, and 1.5% heavier elements ejected from previous stars.
- Higher density areas form nebulae and begins to form spheres in
- Density and pressure increases as gravity continues to pull dust together.
	- 
- Once mass and pressure threshold reached, ignites fusion of hydrogen atoms in the core.
	- Fusion releases energy to "fight back" against the force of gravity, preventing further collapse.
	- When this energy and and pressure
